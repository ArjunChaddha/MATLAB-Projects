# MATLAB Projects

This folder contains the code for my big MATLAB project where I quantified the chaotic behaviour of an n-pendulum. On Python, I created simulations for double, triple, and quadruple pendulums.

The files singlependulumsimulation, doublependulumsimulation, triplependulumsimulation, and quadruplependulumsimulation can be run to simulate pendulums. The other files are used to generate more technical quantitative data for my paper. You can find my research paper attached on this folder as well.
